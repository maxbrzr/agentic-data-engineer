# DCAT-AP-HUB DOCS

# DCAT-AP Hub

`dcat-ap-hub` is a Python library for working with datasets and pretrained models described using DCAT-AP metadata.
It is built around a practical workflow that resolves metadata, downloads artifacts, and loads datasets or models through a single interface.
Currently, metadata parsing supports **JSON-LD** from direct URLs, content negotiation, and local files.

### Typical Workflow

1. Retrieve dataset metadata in DCAT-AP from:
   - remote JSON-LD URLs (`Dataset.from_url(...)`)
   - local metadata files (`Dataset.from_file(...)`)
   - local directories that contain metadata files (`Dataset.from_directory(...)`)

2. Download files referenced by distributions and related resources (`dcat:downloadURL`) into a local dataset directory.

3. Load files or models for use in code:
   - Load files as a lazy `FileCollection` with built-in loaders for common formats such as CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet, images, PDF, text, HTML/XML, and NumPy arrays.
   - Load pretrained models through Hugging Face, ONNX, or sklearn-style model scripts.

### Benchmarking With Catalogues

Optionally, related resources can be used to attach a processor script that is detected automatically and applied to transform raw files.
This enables the definition of multi-dataset benchmarks as DCAT-AP catalogues, since benchmarking requires each dataset to provide a fixed train-test split, which can be generated through these processor scripts.

### Requirements for Metadata

- Each dataset metadata record must include a `dcat:Dataset` entry.
- Entries with `@type` set to `mls:Model` are treated as models.
- Roles for distributions (`dcat:Distribution`) and related resources (`rdfs:Resource`) can be defined through `dct:conformsTo` and/or `dct:format`, allowing the specification of model types or processors.
- The `dcat:downloadURL` field identifies the files to be downloaded.

### How To Install

```bash
# Base install (datasets, processing)
pip install dcat-ap-hub

# Install with ONNX model loading support
pip install "dcat-ap-hub[onnx]"

# Install with Hugging Face model loading support
pip install "dcat-ap-hub[huggingface]"
```

### Example of Loading a Dataset

```python
from dcat_ap_hub import Dataset

url = "https://ki-daten.hlrs.de/de/dataset/https-piveau-io-set-data-predictive-maintenance-ttl"

ds = Dataset.from_url(url)
files = ds.download(data_dir="./data")
```

### Example of Loading a Huggingface Model

```python
from dcat_ap_hub import Dataset

url = "https://ki-daten.hlrs.de/de/model/prajjwal1-bert-tiny"

ds = Dataset.from_url(url)
files = ds.download(data_dir="./data")
model, processor, metadata = ds.load_model(model_dir="./models")
```

### Example of Loading a SKLearn Model

```python
from dcat_ap_hub import Dataset

url = (
    "https://ki-daten.hlrs.de/de/model/https-piveau-io-set-data-pre-trained-transformer"
)

ds = Dataset.from_url(url)
files = ds.download(data_dir="./data")
model = ds.load_model(model_dir="./models")
```

### Example of Processing a Dataset if Available

```python
from dcat_ap_hub import Dataset

url = "https://ki-daten.hlrs.de/de/dataset/https-piveau-io-set-data-predictive-maintenance-ttl"

ds = Dataset.from_url(url)
files = ds.download(data_dir="./data")
processed = ds.process(processed_dir="./processed")
```
